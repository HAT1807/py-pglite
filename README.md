- **Easy Setup**: Quick to install and configure.
- **PostgreSQL Support**: Full compatibility with PostgreSQL.
- **Testing Integration**: Works seamlessly with pytest for unit testing.
- **ORM Compatibility**: Supports SQLAlchemy and SQLModel for database interactions.

## Installation

To install py-pglite, you can use pip. Run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
pip install py-pglite
```

Make sure you have PostgreSQL installed on your machine. You can download it from the [official PostgreSQL website](https://www.postgresql.org/download/).

## Usage

Hereâ€™s a simple example to get you started with py-pglite.

```python
from pglite import PGLite

# Create a new PGLite instance
db = PGLite(database='test_db', user='your_user', password='your_password')

# Create a table
db.execute("""
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS users (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(100),
    age INT
)
""")

# Insert data
db.execute("INSERT INTO users (name, age) VALUES (%s, %s)", ('Alice', 30))

# Query data
results = db.query("SELECT * FROM users")
for row in results:
    print(row)
```

### Configuration

To configure your database connection, you can pass the following parameters when creating a PGLite instance:

- `database`: Name of your PostgreSQL database.
- `user`: Your PostgreSQL username.
- `password`: Your PostgreSQL password.
- `host`: (Optional) Hostname of your PostgreSQL server (default is localhost).
- `port`: (Optional) Port number (default is 5432).

### Example

```python
db = PGLite(database='test_db', user='your_user', password='your_password', host='localhost', port=5432)
```

## Testing

You can run tests using pytest. First, ensure you have pytest installed:

```bash
pip install pytest
```

Then, you can run the tests with the following command:

```bash
pytest
```

For more information on writing tests, refer to the [pytest documentation](https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/).
